# Boxes-appimage
This is my first attempt to port the virtualization solution also known as "GNOME Boxes" to the AppImage format.

NOTE that this is an EXPERIMENTAL BUILD, do not use it as a daily client, rely on the one from your repository or the Flatpak.

# Files
This repository contains:
- A modified version of [github.com/ivan-hc/AppImaGen](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppImaGen), including some additions to made Boxes run (see [here](https://github.com/ivan-hc/Boxes-appimage/blob/main/appimagen));
- A TXT file containing all the answers of this workflow (see [here](https://github.com/ivan-hc/Boxes-appimage/blob/main/list.txt));
- A script named "build.sh that does what its name already suggests (see [here](https://github.com/ivan-hc/Boxes-appimage/blob/main/build.sh)).

# How to build Boxes AppImage by yourself
This AppImage is built from Debian Testing (to see the .deb package, click [here](https://packages.debian.org/en/testing/gnome-boxes)) 

    git clone https://github.com/ivan-hc/Boxes-appimage.git
    cd Boxes-appimage
    chmod a+x appimagen build.sh
    ./build.sh
    cd ..
    version=$(wget -q https://packages.debian.org/en/testing/gnome-boxes -O - | grep "Package:" | head -1 | cut -c 27- | rev | cut -c 2- | rev)
    mv Boxes-appimage/*AppImage Boxes-$version-x86_64.AppImage

# Downloads
Continuous builds are available at https://github.com/ivan-hc/Boxes-appimage/releases/tag/continuous

## What works
The AppImage runs normally.

## What does not work
Boxex requires the access to some online resources to recommend downloads or to made a basic enviroment to run the offline ISO you have downloaded, this is a tipic error message I get:

     util-app.vala:199: Failed to download recommended-downloads file: Non Ã¨ disponibile il supporto a TLS
Due to this I'm unable to check if it is possible to install and use a Virtual Machine.
